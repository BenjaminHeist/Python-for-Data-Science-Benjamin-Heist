ReadMe for Individual Assignment 2: "Python for Data Science"

In this branch, you'll find the code for the exercises related to Individual Assignment 2. I have copied the exercises into the file and in the next cells you will find the code that solces the respective exercises. 

The instructions stated: "You will update your first repository, and for each exercise (after creating the readme), create an individual branch." 

However, I interpreted this to mean that we should create a new branch for each assignment, rather than for each exercise. As a result, I have created a single branch for Assignment 2, instead of separate branches for each exercise. I hope this approach is acceptable.

Additionally, in Exercise 4, where it says "Print the Result: Output the converted temperature for 22째F, 46째F, 51째F, and 76째F", I assumed the temperatures were meant to be in Celsius, since we were asked to create a celsius_to_fahrenheit converter. Therefore, I converted the Celsius values to Fahrenheit, rather than the other way around.
