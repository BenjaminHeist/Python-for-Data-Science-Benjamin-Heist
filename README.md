Read-Me for the repository 'Python-for-Data-Science-Benjamin-Heist'. 

This repository contains the individual assignments of this Python course and will be updated continiously. There will be a new branch for each assignment. In the end these branches will be deleted eventually so that all assignments are just in the main branch. 

ASSIGNMENT 1 

- In the notebook you will find exercises 1-17 of Individual Assignment 1, followed by the respective code solutions in the subsequent cells.

- In order to run all of the cells correctly Python version 3.10 or higher is needed. 

ASSIGNMENT 2 

- In this notebook you'll find exercises 1-4 related to Individual Assignment 2. You can see the tasks followed by che respective code solutions in the subsequent cells.

Assumptions: 

- The instructions stated: "You will update your first repository, and for each exercise (after creating the readme), create an individual branch."
However, I interpreted this to mean that we should create a new branch for each assignment, rather than for each exercise. As a result, I have created a single branch for Assignment 2, instead of separate branches for each exercise. I hope this approach is acceptable.

- In Exercise 4, where it says "Print the Result: Output the converted temperature for 22째F, 46째F, 51째F, and 76째F", I assumed the temperatures were meant to be in Celsius, since we were asked to create a celsius_to_fahrenheit converter. Therefore, I converted the Celsius values to Fahrenheit, rather than the other way around.
